            <p>From 1914 through 1956, Thomas Watson served as the company's chairman and CEO. After working with John Henry Patterson of NCR, he created the corporate culture and managerial style. By creating a culture and management style centered around the use of punch card tabulating devices, he turned IBM into a prosperous company. Before his death in 1956, Watson, a self-made billionaire, was considered as the greatest salesman in history.</p>
